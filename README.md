#Description - 
This project is a Temperature Monitoring System simulated in Tinkercad. It utilizes an Arduino Uno, an LCD display, and an LM35 temperature sensor to measure and display the ambient temperature in real time.

Working:
1. The LM35 sensor detects the surrounding temperature and converts it into an analog voltage.
2. The Arduino Uno reads this voltage, processes the data, and converts it into a temperature value in degrees Celsius.
3. The measured temperature is then displayed on the LCD screen.
This system can be used for real-time temperature monitoring in various applications, such as home automation, weather monitoring, and industrial temperature control.
